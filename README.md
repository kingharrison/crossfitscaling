## CrossFit Scaling, Progressions, and Conversions

I created this site as a reference for myself when working out. If there is a particular skill in a workout that I have not yet mastered, I wanted to be able to easily see the scaling / progressions for the skill so that I may adjust my workout accordingly. As well, if there is some type of cardio in the workout (rowing / running / biking) and needed to do a different type of cardio for any reason I wanted the reference for adjusting to be easy to find. 

**NOTE** I am not a CrossFit coach, this is not meant to replace actual coaching, this is use at your own risk. This is my reference and scaling and linking to publicly availabe videos I found actually helpful and organized in a way for myself that is easy to use.
