## CrossFit Scaling, Progressions, and Conversions

I created this site as a reference for myself when working out. If there is a particular skill in a workout that I have not yet mastered, I wanted to be able to easily see the scaling / progressions for the skill so that I may adjust my workout accordingly. As well, if there is some type of cardio in the workout (rowing / running / biking) and needed to do a different type of cardio for any reason I wanted the reference for adjusting to be easy to find. 

I have tried to list all progressions / drills underneath the said skill in ascending order (from where one would start to where would one finish). If someone could not do the most difficult progression or skill listed, the one before it would be the next logical thing to try (whether just practicing or in a workout). 

I personally, if I cannot do a perscribed skill in a workout, do the drill or progression preceeding the skill within the workout. I find that though the workout might not be as challenging physically, it is better that I learn to progress the skill correctly within the context of a workout. This is a similar approach to how one teaches gymnastic skills or competitive cheerleading. 

**NOTE** I am not a CrossFit coach, this is not meant to replace actual coaching, this is use at your own risk. This is my reference and scaling and linking to publicly availabe videos I found actually helpful and organized in a way for myself that is easy to use. 

**EQUIPMENT** This will assume you have the proper equipment to do the skills or drills at home.
